## Instructions

1. Open index.html in a browser
2. Control player with keyboard arrows
3. Avoid bugs and make it to the water to win!

## Future Development

1. Figure out how to randomize the bug speeds and locations
2. Incorporate "dt" with speed.
3. Add enemy objects dynamically enemy group array
4. Research better way to initiate enemy objects? Feels clunky.
